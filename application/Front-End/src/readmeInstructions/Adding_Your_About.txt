This file will give instructions on how to add your stuff onto the Template page.
and the About page.

Make sure you are inside the Front-End folder before you run 'npm install' to retrieve the node_modules folder.
Then when you have the folder, run 'npm start' to run the server. 

1) You will first upload your picture to the images folder within src. (Preferably a square image)

2) Copy and Paste Template.js and rename it to YourName.js

3) Open your newly named file and change the function name to YourName(). Do the same with the last line export default YourName;

4) Follow the comments to add all of your information into the page and save the page

5) Open App.js within the src folder and add a path to your page. You will use 
   <Route path="/yourname" element{<YourName />} />

6) Once that is done, make your way to the About.html page and choose a cell to add your stuff to

7) Replace Name and Role with Your Name and Your Role and change the Link path to "/yourname" and change the image file to your chosen image

8) That should be everything completed. If any visual bugs or style errors, save all of your information on the html files and @ me on discord
   and I will help you from there.
